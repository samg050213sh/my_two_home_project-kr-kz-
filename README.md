## 📖 "Two Homes, One Heart" - A Personal Journey Between Cultures

### 🌉 Why This Topic? My Personal Story

> "I chose this topic because it represents the most significant event that changed my life. It shows my love for Korea while honoring my homeland where my family, culture, and roots remain."

My Story: In 2022, at 17 years old, I left my hometown Taraz for Seoul. The last time I was home was summer 2023 for just 26 days. Since then, I haven't returned - studies, work, financial challenges. But it's this homesickness, this feeling of being between two worlds, that inspired this project. This isn't just a school project - it's my heart divided between two homes.

### 🍽️ 2. Food Journey

*Purpose:* Food is love in a language all cultures understand. For example:
- 🇰🇿 Kazakh dishes I miss: beshbarmak, baursaks, quyrdak
- 🇰🇷 Korean dishes I've come to love: kimchi, tteokbokki, kimbap
- 📊 Nostalgia index - how much I miss each dish

- 🏡 "Last Evening in Taraz" (2022-09-10) - saying goodbye to childhood
- 👩‍🍳 "Cooking Quyrdak for Korean Friends" (2023-01-11) - pride in my culture
